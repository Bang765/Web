                    <h2>Facts about Cats</h2>
                    <p>five interesting facts about cats: their "meow" is almost exclusively for humans, a cat's nose print is as unique as a
                    human's fingerprint, they have an extra organ to help them "taste-sense" the air, their purr's frequency can promote
                    healing, and they lack a sweet taste receptor, meaning they can't taste sweet things.</p>

                    <p>The study of cats is called felinology. This branch of zoology investigates both domestic and wild cats, examining their
                    anatomy, genetics, behavior, health, and evolutionary history. Felinologists use advanced techniques like GPS tracking
                    and DNA analysis to understand feline biology and improve veterinary care, cat welfare, and responsible ownership
                    practices</p>
