Pizza (Italian: ['pittsa], Neapolitan: ['pittse])
is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a
usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-
based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
various other ingredients (such as anchovies,
mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc. ),
which is then baked at a high temperature,
traditionally in a wood-fired oven. [1] A small
pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who
makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
